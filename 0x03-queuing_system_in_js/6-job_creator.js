/*
Create a queue with Kue
Create an object containing the Job data with the following format:
{
  phoneNumber: string,
  message: string,
}
Create a queue named push_notification_code, and create a job with the object created before
When the job is created without error, log to the console Notification job created: JOB ID
When the job is completed, log to the console Notification job completed
When the job is failing, log to the console Notification job failed
Nothing else will happen - to process the job, go to the next task!

If you execute multiple time this file, you will see the JOB ID increasing - it means you are storing new job to processâ€¦
